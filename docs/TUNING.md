# Tuning blaze to a box

How to pick settings for the hardware you have. Design docs explain *why* the
knobs exist; this says what to set them to.

Every constant here was measured on a **4-core / 15 GB dev box** with 3,000 scopes
and 1–3 scopes per edge. Ratios travel; absolute numbers do not. Re-measure on
your hardware with the harnesses at the bottom — it takes minutes.

## The model: what is actually in RAM

Four terms, and only two of them are yours to lose sleep over.

| term | size | reclaimable? |
|---|---|---|
| **Filters** | ~1.9 bytes per link | **no — heap** |
| **Sparse index** | ~0.2% of base bytes | **no — heap** |
| Leader memtable | `flush_interval x arrival_rate x 50 B` | no, but tiny |
| Follower memtable | `fold_after_links x 50 B` | no, but tiny |
| Mapped runs | up to the full base on disk | **yes — clean page cache** |

The last row is why `RSS` misleads. Measured at 15M links, RSS was 719 MB against
a 0.58 GB base — so ~590 MB of it was clean file-backed pages the kernel drops
under pressure. The unreclaimable part was **~30 MB**. On a small box you do not
OOM, you take more page faults; correctness is unaffected and latency degrades
with cache-miss rate.

So there are two budgets:

- **Heap budget** (hard): filters + sparse index + memtable. Exceed it and you OOM.
- **Page-cache budget** (soft): whatever is left. It sets query latency, not
  whether you run.

## Sizing formulas

With `N` = links of committed state:

```
base on disk    ~= 38 N bytes          (measured 38.7 B/link; design 006 assumed 37.5)
filter heap     ~= 1.9 N bytes         (at --filter-bits 8; halves at 4, ~0 at 0)
sparse index    ~= 0.076 N bytes       (0.2% of base)
leader memtable  = interval_s x rate x 50 bytes
```

The filter term is per **key**, not per link — overlay pairs outnumber links
whenever edges carry several scopes, which is where the 1.9 comes from. On a
single-scope workload expect closer to 1.0.

Worked, at `--filter-bits 8`:

| links | base on disk | heap floor |
|---|---|---|
| 100M | 3.8 GB | 0.2 GB |
| 500M | 19 GB | 1.0 GB |
| 2B | 75 GB | 4.0 GB |
| 10B | 375 GB | 20 GB |

## Worked configurations

**Small box, modest state** — 4 GB RAM, ≤500M links:

```
--routing-base disk --filter-bits 8 --flush-interval-secs 60
--tier-fanout 4 --max-delta-layers 8
```
1 GB heap, ~3 GB of page cache against a 19 GB base (16% resident). Queries fault
often; fine if your SLO is milliseconds rather than microseconds. Low fanout keeps
each merge small so it does not evict the working set.

**Small box, large state** — 4 GB RAM, billions of links:

```
--routing-base disk --filter-bits 0 --flush-interval-secs 60
--tier-fanout 4 --max-delta-layers 8
```
`--filter-bits 0` is the only thing that makes this fit: heap drops from ~4 GB to
~150 MB at 2B links. It costs ~35% ingest throughput (measured 88k → 57k links/s),
which is irrelevant at 50/s and fatal during a backfill — see below.

**Production serving** — 64 GB RAM, 2B links:

```
--routing-base disk --filter-bits 8 --flush-interval-secs 60
--tier-fanout 10 --max-delta-layers 24
```
4 GB heap, ~59 GB of page cache against a 75 GB base (~79% resident). This is the
configuration design 006 sized for, and the one the defaults target.

**Backfill** — whatever box, ingest rate is the objective:

```
--filter-bits 8 --tier-fanout 4 --max-delta-layers 6 --inline-merges
--fold-after-links 5000000
```
Opposite of the serving config on three of four dials, which is the point. Keep
filters (they buy ingest throughput). Keep depth *low*, since ingest resolves
through the stack and pays ~1.3 µs per link per layer. And `--inline-merges` so
ingest cannot outrun compaction and bury you in runs.

## The flags

| flag | default | raise it for | costs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--filter-bits` | 8 | ingest speed, query latency | heap: ~1.9 B/link at 8, ~0 at 0 |
| `--tier-fanout` | 10 | less rewriting (`amp ≈ log_T(F)`) | depth: `(T-1)·log_T(F)` runs to probe |
| `--max-delta-layers` | 24 | fewer merges | every path pays per run |
| `--flush-interval-secs` | 60 | fewer commits | leader memtable **and** your RPO |
| `--fold-after-links` | 1M | fewer follower folds | follower heap only — see gotcha |
| `--inline-merges` | off | ingest that cannot outrun compaction | tick blocks for the whole merge |
| `--routing-base` | ram | — | `disk` is the low-memory mode |

**The gotcha:** `--fold-after-links` does nothing on a leader. The check is
`!force && links < fold_after_links`, and a leader always passes `force = true`
because it needs a layer to commit. On the writer, memtable size is governed by
`--flush-interval-secs`.

## Measured trade curves

Depth, on identical state (`examples/layer_depth`):

| layers | ingest/s | lookup |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 216,963 | 1.01 µs |
| 8 | 109,487 | 3.10 µs |
| 16 | 65,850 | 4.90 µs |

≈1.3 µs per link per layer, ≈0.65 µs per lookup per layer.

Filters, through the real flusher at 2M links (`examples/detached_merge`):

| `--filter-bits` | index heap | ingest/s |
|---|---|---|
| 8 | 4044 KB | 88k |
| 4 | 2125 KB | 72k |
| 0 | 273 KB | 57k |

Detached vs inline merges, 3M links at matched schedule:

| | peak memtable | p99 tick | max tick |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--inline-merges` | 661,468 | 1200 ms | 3258 ms |
| default (detached) | 111,168 | 296 ms | 650 ms |

## Serving and backfill pull opposite ways

Worth stating because three flags invert between them:

| | serving (50/s) | backfill (saturated) |
|---|---|---|
| `--filter-bits` | low is fine — heap matters more | **high** — ingest throughput |
| `--max-delta-layers` | high is fine — 2k/s is 2% of capacity | **low** — depth taxes every link |
| `--inline-merges` | off — keep the memtable bounded | **on** — throttle ingest |

If you run one deployment for both, size for serving and override for the backfill
window.

## What to watch

- **Run count over `--max-delta-layers`.** The flush loop warns. It means merges
  are not keeping up, and nothing else will notice — every path degrades smoothly
  rather than failing.
- **Peak memtable links.** Should track `flush_interval x rate` on a leader. If it
  does not, a tick is stalling.
- **Tick duration p99.** A slow tick is watermark not advancing, i.e. your RPO.
- **Heap versus RSS.** Rising RSS with flat heap is page cache doing its job, not
  a leak.

## Measuring on your own hardware

```bash
# memory floor and tick latency, real Flusher with concurrent ingest
FILTER_BITS=8 LINKS=3000000 RATE=100000 SCOPES=3000 \
  cargo run --release --example detached_merge

# write amplification, flat vs tiered at matched depth
LINKS=2000000 FOLD_LINKS=4000 MAX_LAYERS=12 FANOUT=10 \
  cargo run --release --example tier_amplification

# what depth costs, in isolation
cargo run --release --example layer_depth

# run until something gives; prints RSS, base size, ingest, lookup, compaction
LINKS=40000000 SCOPES=3000 FOLD_LINKS=5000000 MAX_LAYERS=8 \
  cargo run --release --example ceiling
```

`ceiling` predates tiering and uses flat compaction, so its RSS figures are
pessimistic for the shipped policy — it sweeps the whole base each cycle where a
tiered merge touches a subset.
